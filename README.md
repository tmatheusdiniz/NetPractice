## 📖 About

The goal of the NetPractice project is to configure small and medium-scale networks and make them functional by understanding fundamental networking concepts such as:

- **TCP/IP protocols** - Understanding how data is transmitted across networks
- **IP addressing** - Assigning unique identifiers to network devices
- **Subnetting** - Dividing networks into smaller, manageable segments
- **Subnet masks** - Determining network and host portions of IP addresses
- **Network devices** - Hubs, switches, and routers and their roles

You'll also need to master networking notations such as CIDR notation, network IDs, broadcast addresses, and routing table configurations.

I learned from this excellent playlist by **PowerCert Animated Videos** on YouTube:
- [Networking Fundamentals Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mad4kQ5835Y&list=PL7zRJGi6nMRzg0LdsR7F3olyLGoBcIvvg)

I also recommend the book **Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach** for a deeper understanding of networking principles.
